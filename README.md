My Dashboard consists of four tabs that navigate you through the dashboard panel 
showing Real Estate data in San Francisco from 2010 to 2016. The first tab is a brief
introduction. The second tab shows rental analysis data using interactive line charts.
The third tab visualizes the analysis of neighborhood data, and the final tab gives a 
map visualization of the average sales price per square foot and gross rent.
